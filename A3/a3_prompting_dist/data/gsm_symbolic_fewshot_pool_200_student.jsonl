If 68 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 31-kilometer walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Tara walks at a rate of 17 kilometers per 68 minutes, or 17/68 = 1/4 kilometers per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at 2 times the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/4 = 1/2 kilometers per minute.\nTo walk 14 kilometers on the sidewalk, it takes her 14÷1/2=28 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Tara 68+28=96 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 96"}

{"question": "Nadia can run two times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 2/5 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 1/10 of the time running, 2/5 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?", "answer": "If Nadia can skip at 2/5 the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*5/2=10 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 2 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.\nNadia spent 2/5 + 1/10 = 1/2 of the time either skipping or running. So she spent 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the total time walking.\nIf 1/2 of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 10*1/2=5 hours.\nIf 1/10 of the time is spent running, then she runs for 10 * 1/10=1 hours.\nIf 2/5 of the time is spent skipping, then she skips for 10 * 2/5=4 hours.\nShe walks for 5 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 5*5=25 miles.\nshe runs for 1 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 1*10=10 miles.\nShe skips for 4 hours at 4 miles per hour.
