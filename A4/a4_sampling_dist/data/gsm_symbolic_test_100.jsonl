{"question": "Jin saw a 45-foot dolphin with 18 9-inch remoras attached to it. But 1/3 of the remoras go away. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?", "answer": "First, find the total number of remoras remaining: 18 - 18*1/3 =  12.\nThen, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 9 inches/remora * 12 remoras = 108 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 162 inches / 12 inches/foot = 9 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 9 foot / 45 feet * 100% = 20%\n\n#### 20"}

How much does he earn in a year after paying 20% in taxes?", "answer": "The plumber works for 5 days every week and works for 3 weeks every month so he works for 5 days/week * 3 weeks/month = 15 days/month\nIf he earns ₣9 every day he then earns ₣9/day * 15 days/month = ₣135/month\nA year is equal to 12 months so every year he earns ₣135/month * 12 months/year = ₣1620. \nTo calculate the taxes, we calculate 20% * 1620 = 324. \nThen we reduce the tax amount: 1620 - 324 = 1296\n#### 1296"}
{"question": "Mateo is feeding his livestock grain. Each llama needs 12 kg, and each goat needs 3 kg less than twice the amount each llama needs. Each alpaca eats as much as a llama and goat eat combined. If there are 12 llamas, 16 goats, and 18 alpacas, how many kg of grain does Mateo need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each goat needs: 12 kg * 2 - 3 = 21 kg/goat.\nNow figure out how much grain total the goats need: 21 kg/goat * 16 goat = 336 kg.\nNow we find out how much grain each alpaca needs: 21 + 12 = 33. Since there are 18 of alpacas, we have 18 * 33 = 594\nNow figure out how much grain total the llamas need: 12 kg/llama * 12 llamas = 144 kg\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 336 kg + 144 kg + 594 kg = 1074 kg.\n#### 1074"}
